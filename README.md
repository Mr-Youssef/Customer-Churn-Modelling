# Customer-Churn-Modelling
Based upon data of employees of a bank we calculate whether an employee stands a chance to stay in the company or not using the [Churn Modelling](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shubh0799/churn-modelling) dataset from Kaggle. 
Moreover, I have used Tableau for data visualization purposes and EDA in addition to writing some SQL queries. In this project I have developed a deep learning model for the classification using ANN from Keras.
